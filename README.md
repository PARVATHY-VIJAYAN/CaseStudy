Understanding and Fine-Tuning BERT for NLP Tasks

This repository includes a detailed case study and Python code implementation that explore fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for NLP tasks, such as text classification and named entity recognition.

Key Features:
Case Study Presentation: An in-depth exploration of BERT, including its architecture, pretraining objectives, and practical applications.
Fine-Tuning Process: A step-by-step guide to fine-tuning BERT for a specific task, covering dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation using TensorFlow and Hugging Face’s Transformers library.
Code Implementation: Python code for training BERT on the CoLA dataset, including tokenization, attention mask creation, and model evaluation using Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC).
Results: Achieved 82% accuracy with only 4 epochs of training on a small dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning over training from scratch.
